ALGORITHAM..................

Step 1 :  Start
Step 2 : Take Range from user 
Step 3 : SET sum =0, start = starting number and end = ending number in the range
Step 4 : SET i as start, i <= end 
Step 5 : Check if i is divisible by any number and the remender 0, except 1 and itself
Step 6 : if step 5 is true is then sum = sum+i
Step 7: increase i by 1
Step 8: repeat step 5, 6, 7 utill i > end 
Step 9: Print sum


PSEUDOCODE.........

BEGIN
	GET rang from the user
	SET sum =0,  start = starting number and end = ending number in the range
	SET i as start, i <= end 
	CHECK if i not % by any number execpt 1 and itself then sum = sum+i ,i = i+1
	REPEAT 
	PRINT sum
	
END
